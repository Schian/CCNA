# Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol

RSTP is not a timer-based spanning tree algorithm like 802.1D. Therefore, RSTP offers an improvement over the 30 second or more that 802.1D takes to move a link to forwarding. The heart of the protocol is a new bridge-to-bridge handshake mechanism, which allows ports to move directly to forwarding.
